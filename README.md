## Overview
This analysis focuses on creating visualizations in Tableau using data from Citi Bike's New York City program for an investment opportunity in a bikesharing program in Des Moines, IA. Although NYC and Des Moines are very different cities, the proposal is intended to highlight observations indicating the program to be a profitable venture.

## Results
Based on the data shown, the results are as follows:
- Most Citi Bike users only ride for about 5 minutes.
- The busiest times for Citi Bike are mornings and evenings on weekdays.
- For busier times, Manhattan seems to be the prime spot for users.

## Summary
While NYC is a much larger city than Des Moines, it can be seen that there is high use in downtown areas. We can conclude from this observation and the traffic by hour each day that downtown users enjoy its convenience for their commute to and from work.
